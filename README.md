## Objective
Design and build your own RESTful API using Node.js and Express. The API should handle CRUD operations 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a specific resource. Create a sample resource directly in the 
server.js file instead of using a database.

## Task Description

* Set up a new Node.js project with Express.
* Create the necessary routes for CRUD operations on your chosen resource.
  * Define routes for handling GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
  * Use Express's routing methods (app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete()) to define the routes.
* Implement route handlers and appropriate logic for each CRUD operation.
  * Write the corresponding route handler functions for each route.
  * Implement the logic to handle CRUD operations on your chosen resource.
  * Use the Express req and res objects to access request data and send response data.
* Store the sample resource data directly in the server.js file since we are not using a traditional databse.
  * Define an array or object within the server.js file to serve as your sample resource data.
  * Populate the array or object with sample resource data that represents your chosen resource.
* Handle HTTP requests and responses using Express.
* Implement error handling for invalid routes.
